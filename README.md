Code for SPIKE Prime web interface
(2020 July 7)

"server" folder includes up-to-date development on the interface. Demo of the interface can only work when hosted on a web server (otherwise jquery load won't work). Currently, the web server is being hosted by node, in place of tuftsceeo website.

To use:
1. download repository
2. install node js
3. change directory to the repository, and to "server" folder
4. execute "npm init" to install node_modules
5. execute "node app.js" to start server.
6. go to http://localhost:3000/ to start


"development" folder includes examples made BEFORE development moved to web server, so many files are outdated. But old HTML files in "development/examples" can still be dragged to Chrome browser for demo.
